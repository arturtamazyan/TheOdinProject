    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 large (8 ounces) sweet potato, cut into 1/4-inch wedges</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 cups small broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2 (5-6-ounces) salmon fillets</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Step 1</h2>

    <p>Combine chili-garlic sauce, hoisin sauce, shrimp stock, tomato paste, mirin, sesame oil,
    2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger, 1 clove minced garlic, shallot,
    and cilantro in a blender or small food processor.Pulse several times to chop, then pur√©e,
    30 to 45 seconds.
    Set sauce aside, or refrigerate until needed.</p>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium high heat.
    When oil is hot, add garlic and ginger slices. Cook until browned,
    watching closely to avoid burning,about 2 minutes.
    Carefully remove garlic and ginger from the oil and discard.</p>

    <h2>Step 3</h2>

    <p>To the seasoned oil, carefully add shrimp and cook until it just begins to turn
    pink and curl head to tail, about 2 minutes. Turn shrimp and add prepared sauce.
    Cook, stirring, until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.
    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>

    <p>Remove shrimp from the skillet and keep warm.
    Continue cooking and stirring sauce until thickened and reduced to about 3/4 cup.</p>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>

    <p>Pour thickened sauce over shrimp, and toss to cover.</p>
